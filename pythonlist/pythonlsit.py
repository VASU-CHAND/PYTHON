# list are used to store multiple items in a single variable list is a datatype in python
#list items are ordered , changeble and allow duplicate values 
#list items are index , the first item has index [0] , the second item has index [1] 
#when we say that list are ordered it means that the items have a defined order . 
# if you add newitems to a list , the new items will be placed at the end of the list
#the list is changeble meaning that we can change remove and add items in a list after it has been created 
#since list are index , ;ists can have items with the same values ex - list1=["maths","physics","chemistry"]

list = ["maths", "maths","physics","chemistry"]
print(list)
print(len(list))
print(type(list))
